# BizCardX: Extracting Business Card Data with OCR

## Overview

BizCardX is a Python application that allows you to extract and manage data from business cards using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. With a user-friendly Streamlit GUI, this tool makes it easy to digitise and organise business card information in a structured SQL database.

## Technologies Used

- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition):** BizCardX leverages OCR technology to extract text data from business cards, including names, phone numbers, email addresses, and more.

- **Streamlit GUI:** The user interface of BizCardX is built using Streamlit, a popular Python library for creating web applications with minimal effort.

- **SQL (Structured Query Language):** BizCardX uses SQL to create and manage a database where extracted business card data is stored in a structured format.

- **Data Extraction:** This project involves data extraction techniques to parse and structure the information extracted from business cards accurately.

## Features

- **Business Card Scanning:** Users can upload images of business cards, and BizCardX will automatically extract relevant information from them.

- **Data Validation:** The extracted data is validated for accuracy and completeness, reducing errors.

- **SQL Database:** All extracted data is stored in an SQL database, allowing users to query and manage their business card information easily.

- **Search and Retrieval:** Users can search for specific business cards by name, company, or other criteria.

- **Export and Backup:** The application provides options to export data and create backups for safekeeping.
